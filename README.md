## Challenge Overview
In this project, I designed and implemented a virtual private cloud architecture featuring public and private subnets across two availability zones. My architecture includes a NAT instance to facilitate secure outbound internet access for resources in the private subnets, a load balancer to efficiently distribute incoming traffic, and auto-scaling groups to dynamically adjust the number of instances based on demand. Additionally, I integrated amazon cloudFront as a content delivery network, configuring it to serve content with region restrictions specifically limited to Kenya, ensuring low-latency access for local users.
